Production-grade data warehouse built on Medallion Architecture, featuring raw ingestion (Bronze), refined business entities (Silver), and Star Schema–modeled Gold tables for scalable analytics, ML and BI consumption.

Overview

This repository implements a modern end-to-end data warehouse using the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold).
It is designed to ingest raw data from source systems, progressively refine it through standardized transformations, and deliver analytics-ready datasets modeled using a Star Schema for reporting and business intelligence.

The architecture emphasizes data quality, auditability, scalability, and reusability, making it suitable for both analytical workloads and production-grade deployments.
